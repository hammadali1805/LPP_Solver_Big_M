# LPP_Solver_Big_M
This Python script implements the Simplex method with the Big M technique to solve Linear Programming Problems (LLP). It takes input in the form of linear inequalities and equations and determines the optimal solution. The code can handle various conditions such as unbounded solutions, infeasible solutions, and multiple optimal solutions.
